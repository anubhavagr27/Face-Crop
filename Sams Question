A binary matrix of n X m, you have to toggle any column k number of times so that you can get maximum rows having all 1.
Given a graph having edges defining the probability of going to a particular node, say edge u-v denotes the probability of going v from u. you can stay at any node for 10 minutes. Starting from node 1, on which node you will be after T minutes and with what probability.
Find a cycle, if exists, in a directed graph. If there is none, print 0. If there is one, print the path starting from the first node of the cycle to the last. If there are more than one, print any path. Test cases to be passed-10 max
