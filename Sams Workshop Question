Jack wants to buy N fruits from the food market. 
 (For the sake of the convenience, fruits will be denoted as numbers). 
 So Jack needs baskets to put his fruits. 
 Unfortunately, there are only two baskets left in the food market. 
 Thus, Jack is carrying two baskets and picking up his fruits. He can put the fruits into the baskets as follows:
 Putting them into basket 1. 
 Putting them into basket 2.




Putting them into none of the baskets.
 The fruit price ranges from 1 to 1000 Won. There can be several fruits with the same price. However, they are considered as different fruits. Thus, there can be in total 3N number of possible situations.
 


Now Jack wants to write a program that compares the fruits in the two baskets. The comparison works as follows: Write a program that finds 




 the number of times when the fruit price values in basket 1 all XOR with one another (exclusive OR) and the fruit price values in basket 2 all XOR are the same.





[Input]

The first line contains T the number of total test cases.
 The first line of each test case contains N (1≤N≤16).
 On the next line, N space-separated number of fruit prices will be given. 
 Each fruit price is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1,000.




[Output]

For each test case, Print out answers for each of the test cases. Start each line with ‘#x’, leave a blank space, and print the number of times when the XOR values of fruit prices in basket 1 (exclusive OR) and all of the XOR values of fruit prices in basket 2 are the same.
 Since the answer may get very big, print it modulo 1,000,000,007.




[Sample Input/Output]



Input Example
 
Output Example
 

1      // number of TestCases T = 1

2      // N number of fruits N = 2

3 3   // prices of N number of fruits
 N1 = 3, N2 = 3
 
#1 5     // answer to TestCase1
 




 
Example) 
 1. Not Putting any fruit (1 case)
 2. Putting two fruits in the same basket (2 cases)




3. Putting two fruits in different baskets (2 cases), in total 5 cases.

 In case of number 2, there are fruits in either basket 1 or 2 with the prices N1, N2. 
 In case of number 3 it is 011. If we perform XOR for both fruits, we get 000.
 The values of both baskets are 0. Thus, in case of number 2, 2 is the answer.
